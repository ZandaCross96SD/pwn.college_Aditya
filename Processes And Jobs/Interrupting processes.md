# Interrupting Processes
the objective for this challenge is to use Ctrl+C cmd to stop the current process to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UHlWJQNUv1qIgjNjOUqmplZJlk_.QXzQDO0wSN5AzNzEzW}`

In this challegne i ran the /cha*/run cmd and then interrupted it using ctrl+c to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
