- I initially checked SoundCloud but found nothing.

- I then searched for various music ratings websites (including RateYourMusic, Album of The Year, and Album Music Ratings).

- On the RateYourMusic profile for citadweller I found the second portion of the flag.

- A TinyURL on that profile redirected to Spotify, where the third portion was located.

- I checked many other sites for the remaining piece with no luck.

- Finally, I visited last.fm (the user page for citadweller) and recovered the first portion of the flag.
