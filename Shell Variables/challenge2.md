# Setting Variables
The objective of this challenge is to assign values to variables using = to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{A0nuhhLp98L9d8sMQFi-CVsxX2t.QX5UTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}`

I gave the value COLLEGE to variable PWN in this challenge using = making sure there is no space in betweeen to get the flag for this challenge.
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{A0nuhhLp98L9d8sMQFi-CVsxX2t.QX5UTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}
```
