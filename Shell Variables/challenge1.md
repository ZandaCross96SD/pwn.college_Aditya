# Printing Variables
The objective of this challenge is to intorduce variables and printing the variables value to get flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{svtPBahEoZ3lL5dxkAqq4SFV-hs.QX3UTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}`

This challenge was straightforward I echoed the variable FLAG after prepending it to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{svtPBahEoZ3lL5dxkAqq4SFV-hs.QX3UTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned about variables and how we need to prepend them to print them in linux.

## References 
None.
