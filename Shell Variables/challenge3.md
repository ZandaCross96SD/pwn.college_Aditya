# Multi word variables
In this challenge one needs to assign multi word value ot variablle PWN to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{o_kCQQVMQjz7YGW7RN0dW1lOUr2.QXwYTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}`

In this challenge I put the value COLLEGE YEAH inside quotes and assigned it to variable PWN to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{o_kCQQVMQjz7YGW7RN0dW1lOUr2.QXwYTN0wSN5AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learend about using quotes to assign multi word statements to variable without generating errors in linux shell.

## References 
None.
