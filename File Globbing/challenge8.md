# Tab Completion
The objective of this challenge is to use Tab completrion with cat to access flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{so94VpTklh7SCf3Blpm1wUkzqbR.0FN0EzNxwSN5AzNzEzW}`

After typing pwn in the path I pressed Tab like in the example which gave me the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{so94VpTklh7SCf3Blpm1wUkzqbR.0FN0EzNxwSN5AzNzEzW}
```
