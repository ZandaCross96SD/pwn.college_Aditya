# handling failure
the objective for this challenge is to use || conditional chaining to chain 2 cmds to get the glag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yk8UVQfxh-QM60sIE4ScEID14M8.01M0MDOxwSN5AzNzEzW}`

in this cahllenge i chained the 2 commands using || to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{Yk8UVQfxh-QM60sIE4ScEID14M8.01M0MDOxwSN5AzNzEzW}
```
