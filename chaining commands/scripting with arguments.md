# scripting with arguments
the objective for this challenge is to use $n for placeholders in your script to accept arguments to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qnq4nwJGT8JimK4adJGnqEGIrbh.0VNzMDOxwSN5AzNzEzW}`

in this challenge i made the file solve.sh with the first line same as before and echo"$2 $1" as the second line adn then ran teh givne command to get the flag.
```bash
